## [https://poxdb.com](https://www.poxdb.com/#/)

Small database interface app for a side-project I am working on. Based on the old handheld POX games by Hasbro.
Currently, supports searching for parts by name only.

## Todo

- Search by type, trigger, frequency, shortname, and location.
- Clean up the API on the server end.
- Add images on the item pages.
- Implement pagination on the results page.
- Add effects into the database.
- Need to redo CSS w/ proper media queries.
